# CManGOS Individual XP Module - Addon
Iâ€™ve created an addon for that allows players to control their experience gain rate by ***right-clicking their XP bar***. This addon is perfect for players who want to customize their leveling experience without the need for command knowledge, whether they prefer a faster pace or the classic Blizzlike progression.
  
# How to install
