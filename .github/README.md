# AzerothCore Individual XP Module - Addon
I’ve created an addon for *AzerothCore’s Individual XP Module* that allows players to control their experience gain rate by ***right-clicking their XP bar***. This addon is perfect for players who want to customize their leveling experience without the need for command knowledge, whether they prefer a faster pace or the classic Blizzlike progression.
  
# How to install
*Players can skip step one.*
1) Clone [this module](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-individual-xp) & follow the instructions listed on that repository.
2) Apply this addon into your World of Warcraft folder.
